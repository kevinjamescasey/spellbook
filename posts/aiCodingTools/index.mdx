I haven't tried GitHub Copilot or llm-vscode yet. I made some assumptions about GH Copilot. The other ones I tried myself. I will update as I learn more and features change.

These are details about what I experienced.

[GitHub Copilot](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.copilot)
* only free if you can prove you're paying for school
* requires sign in
* 30 day free trial
* haven't tried
* provides limited controls to create [custom models](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/copilot/customizing-copilot/creating-a-custom-model-for-github-copilot)
* supposedly it will start [allowing the use of models from other providers](https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/29/24282544/github-copilot-multi-model-anthropic-google-open-ai-github-spark-announcement)

[Codeium](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Codeium.codeium)
* requires sign in for every VSCode window
* after sign in immediately responded to chat without choosing a models
  - using Codeium model in cloud via API based on Llama
* requires paying for any other models
* was able to view contents of workspace and summarize
* required a VSCode window reload for one window
* ghost suggestions just randomly started and sometimes don't appear
* suggestions based on comments
* if you undo or delete it may not suggest the same thing again
* when I ask it add comments to multiple files it suggests a script that will do it, but it won't edit for me
* [self hosted but not free model server](https://codeium.com/blog/self-hosting-is-easy)

[CodeGPT: Chat & AI Agents](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=DanielSanMedium.dscodegpt)
* even after signing can use 8 free daily interactions
  - requires selecting an agent
    - can just select New Agent
* very few extension settings
  - but configurable directly in UI pane
* separate chat and completion models
* appears to support many models but remote API connections don't work after providing API keys
* ghost completion suggestions didn't seem to work for a long time
  - then finally started working for some reason after signing in and switching providers back and forth
  - `/fix` with an empty function will generate a function that can be inserted
* allows local models
* Can only see current tab's file but you can tell it to remember files one at a time

[Cody: AI Coding Assistant with Autocomplete & Chat](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=sourcegraph.cody-ai)
* requires sign in
* immediately downloads a search index for repository in current workspace
* great docs showing [supported models](https://sourcegraph.com/docs/cody/capabilities/supported-models)
* easy to switch between free third party model APIs
* chat suggests commands to run in terminal and you can run them with a couple  button click (not that useful)
* click the @ symbol or type it in chat to provide context from local files or remote websites
  - doesn't seem to read all files in repository even thought there is an option to provide it
  - extra [Cody++](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=mnismt.cody-plus-plus) extension will paste all files into chat to provide their contents as context 
  - does not understand directory structure
* There is an apply button on code snippets in chat that will try to apply changes to your current tab

[llm-vscode](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=HuggingFace.huggingface-vscode)
* not tried yet


## Emacs

I may not get around to trying these since I'm mostly switching over to VSCode

## Tools I haven't tried yet
Cursor - Non-free VSCode fork 
ChatGPT Code interpreter - Supposed to compile and run code. Should allow LLM to do anything it can write code for.  
Chatgpt voice mode - Interact with your voice instead of fingers.  
Google Gemini voice mode - Interact with your voice instead of fingers.
