This lists a myriad of ways to control access in AWS to primarily custom services. It is also relevant to AWS services and ultimately data that is accessed through services.

## Identity

These tend to be for human users

- IAM users
- Cognito User Pools
- Cognito Federated Identities
- [IAM identity provider federation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_providers.html)
- [IAM Identity Center](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/singlesignon/latest/userguide/what-is.html)

These are for machines

- Lamda execution roles
- Container execution roles
- EC2 instance roles
- store credentials
- [IAM roles anywhere](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/rolesanywhere/latest/userguide/introduction.html)

## Access Control

### Access barriers

Rejecting or allowing requests. Tying authentication to authorization.

- [API Gateway REST API Access Control](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/apigateway-control-access-to-api.html) various methods
  - Lambda Authorizer
  - ...
- [API Gateway HTTP API Access Control](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/http-api-access-control.html) various methods
  - Lambda Authorizer
  - ...
- [Cognito User Pool](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/accessing-resources.html) delegates to other services that accept JWTs
- [API Gateway REST API + Cognito User Pool or OIDC + Verified Permissions](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/authorize-api-gateway-apis-using-amazon-verified-permissions-and-amazon-cognito/)
- [ALB authentication](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/application/listener-authenticate-users.html) ([blog](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/networking-and-content-delivery/security-best-practices-when-using-alb-authentication/))
- [Appsync](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/appsync/latest/devguide/security-authz.html)
  - Lambda Authorizer
  - ...
- [API Gatewya REST API client certificates](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/rest-api-mutual-tls.html)
- run a reverse proxy on compute resources
  - [example: VPC Lattice + Envoy](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/modern-web-application-authentication-and-authorization-with-amazon-vpc-lattice/)
- in the end service
  - [example: Quarkus + EKS](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/access-token-security-for-microservice-apis-on-amazon-eks/)
  - [example: call AWS Verified Permissions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/verifiedpermissions/latest/userguide/authorization-sdk.html)

### Authorization configuration

Configuring permissions with policies, rules, and mappings

- claims and scopes from identity providers
- IAM role policies
- IAM user groups
- IAM rules based on resource tags (depends on how fine grained the resources can be tagged) ([ABAC blog](https://www.nccgroup.com/us/research-blog/introduction-to-aws-attribute-based-access-control/))
- [AppSync query, mutation, and field level](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/appsync/latest/devguide/security-authz.html#using-additional-authorization-modes)
- [AppSync data level](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/appsync/latest/devguide/security-authorization-use-cases.html)
- [Verified Permissions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/verifiedpermissions/latest/userguide/what-is-avp.html)

#### Mapping authorization config

Mapping some authorization config to AWS IAM permissions

- [Cognito Identity Pool ABAC](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/attributes-for-access-control.html)
- [Cognito Identity Pool RBAC](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/role-based-access-control.html)

Mapping AWS IAM credentials to something else

- Exchange AWS credentials for other AWS Credentials: assume role
- Echange AWS credentials for tokens: [service bearer tokens](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_bearer.html) (esoteric)

Giving something else permissions?

- PassRole
