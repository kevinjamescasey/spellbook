This lists a myriad of ways to control access in AWS to primarily custom services. It is also relevant to AWS services and ultimately data that is accessed through services.

## Identity

These are for human users

- Cognito User Pools
- Cognito Federated Identities
- [IAM identity provider federation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_providers.html)
- [IAM Identity Center](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/singlesignon/latest/userguide/what-is.html)

These are for machines

- Service roles
  - Lambda execution roles
  - ECS task roles
  - EC2 instance profile roles
  - etc.
- stored long-term credentials (when AWS IAM authentication can't be used)
- [IAM roles anywhere](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/rolesanywhere/latest/userguide/introduction.html)

These are for both
- root user
  - avoid using as identity
  - do use in policies to represent a whole account (with conditions)
- IAM users (when roles can't be used)

Mapping AWS IAM credentials to something else

- Exchange AWS credentials for other AWS Credentials: assume role
- Exchange AWS credentials for tokens: [service bearer tokens](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_bearer.html) (esoteric)
- Exchange AWS credentials for RDS password: [RDS IAM Authentication](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.IAMDBAuth.html) 

### Domain Validation

Custom software on any compute service

## Access Control

### Access barriers

Rejecting or allowing requests. Tying authentication to authorization.

- [API Gateway REST API Access Control](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/apigateway-control-access-to-api.html) various methods
  - Lambda Authorizer
  - ...
- [API Gateway HTTP API Access Control](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/http-api-access-control.html) various methods
  - Lambda Authorizer
  - ...
- [Cognito User Pool](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/accessing-resources.html) delegates to other services that accept JWTs
- [API Gateway REST API + Cognito User Pool or OIDC + Verified Permissions](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/authorize-api-gateway-apis-using-amazon-verified-permissions-and-amazon-cognito/)
- [ALB authentication](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/application/listener-authenticate-users.html) ([blog](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/networking-and-content-delivery/security-best-practices-when-using-alb-authentication/))
- [Appsync](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/appsync/latest/devguide/security-authz.html)
  - Lambda Authorizer
  - ...
- [API Gateway REST API client certificates](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/rest-api-mutual-tls.html)
- run a reverse proxy on compute resources
  - [example: VPC Lattice + Envoy](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/modern-web-application-authentication-and-authorization-with-amazon-vpc-lattice/)
- in the end service
  - [example: Quarkus + EKS](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/access-token-security-for-microservice-apis-on-amazon-eks/)
  - [example: call AWS Verified Permissions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/verifiedpermissions/latest/userguide/authorization-sdk.html)
  - look up additional Cognito User Pool user attributes in Cognito API to get info not included in JWT then make authz decisions
- [CloudFront Signed URLs and Cookies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/PrivateContent.html) + [Cache Behavior](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/distribution-web-values-specify.html#DownloadDistValuesRestrictViewerAccess)
- [S3 Presigned URLs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/using-presigned-url.html)

### Authorization configuration

Configuring permissions with policies, rules, and mappings

- claims and scopes from identity providers
- IAM role policies
- IAM user groups
- IAM rules based on resource tags (depends on how fine grained the resources can be tagged) ([ABAC blog](https://www.nccgroup.com/us/research-blog/introduction-to-aws-attribute-based-access-control/))
- [AppSync query, mutation, and field level](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/appsync/latest/devguide/security-authz.html#using-additional-authorization-modes)
- [AppSync data level](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/appsync/latest/devguide/security-authorization-use-cases.html)
- [Verified Permissions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/verifiedpermissions/latest/userguide/what-is-avp.html)
- [Cognito User Pool Lambda triggers](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/cognito-user-pools-working-with-lambda-triggers.html) can modify claims

#### Mapping authorization config

Mapping some authorization config to AWS IAM permissions

- [Cognito Identity Pool ABAC](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/attributes-for-access-control.html)
- [Cognito Identity Pool RBAC](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/role-based-access-control.html)

#### AWS IAM decisions affected by
- [condition keys](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_policies_condition-keys.html) refer to attributes of the [request context](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_policies_elements_condition.html)
- names of resources
- attributes of the request
- current time
- [variables and tags](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_policies_variables.html#policy-vars-no-value)

#### Assuming Roles
- iam:PassRole gives a service permission to assume a service role

##### Role Chaining
- Assuming a role in the same account requires only a trust policy
- Assuming a role in a different account also requires a policy on the assuming role
- Assuming role must exist before trust policy refers to it as a trusted principal
  - If deleted trust policy will show role ID of the non-existent assuming role
  - Conditions based on `aws:PrincipalArn` do not have these timing issues


#### [Role docs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles.html)
- [How to use trust policies with IAM roles](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/how-to-use-trust-policies-with-iam-roles/) has many good examples
- [AWS JSON policy elements: Principal](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_policies_elements_principal.html#Principal_specifying) shows how to define different types of principals in policies
- [Methods to assume a role](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_manage-assume.html)
