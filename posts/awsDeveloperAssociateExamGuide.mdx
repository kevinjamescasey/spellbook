<details>
  <summary>summary</summary>
  It's a highly durable and widely available object storage service that allows users
  to store and serve large amounts of data in various formats, such as images, videos,
  documents, and audio files. It provides a simple and cost-effective way to store
  and retrieve data, with features like versioning, lifecycle management, and encryption.
  It also supports various access methods, including public access, private access,
  and bucket policies, making it suitable for a wide range of use cases, from web
  applications to big data analytics and machine learning workloads.

#### [Amazon S3 Glacier](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/glacier-storage-classes.html)

<details>
  <summary>summary</summary>
  It's a long-term, low-cost storage solution designed for infrequently accessed
  data, such as archived files, backup copies, and static assets. It provides a durable
  and secure environment for storing large amounts of data, with features like data
  durability, encryption, and versioning. The service is optimized for cold storage,
  which means it's less expensive than other storage options but requires more time
  to access the data.
