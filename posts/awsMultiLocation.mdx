This helps decide which location concerns you need to consider when designing systems with AWS resources. Surely many resources from many service are still missing from the lists.
  
# Beyond Regions

Services with high replication so you don't have to set up each region separately and figure out how to use each region at the appropriate time. You still need to configure these to integrate with your region-specific resources.

These services are essentially assumed to have 100% uptime. We blindly trust AWS to make them always available by whatever means they choose. We don't really need to know if they make a few copies in different regions or thousands of copies spread out all over. They are considered to be Global in the web console.

# Multi-Region

These are services that offer cross-region capabilities. You choose the subset of regions and it costs more for each region.

# Single Region

Resources with no way to copy or automatically replicate to another region. You can create more of them in other regions yourself but then, if needed, it is up to you to keep their config and data in sync.

#### Zoneless

These typically don't require choosing a specific AZ, but many of them can connect to subnets in specific AZs.
  
AMC certs  
The VPC itself (without subnets)  
Internet Gateway  
CloudWatch Logs  
SQS queue  
SNS topic  
EventBridge bus  
Lambda function (can access subnets with ENIs)  
Glue (can access  subnets with ENIs)  
App Runner ([can access subnets with ENIs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apprunner/latest/dg/network-vpc.html))  
DynamoDB  
  
Amplify?

#### Multi-AZ

You choose the AZs, and some cross-AZ concerns are handled automatically.

#### Cross AZ Communication

[Transferring data between AZs usually costs money.](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/pricing/on-demand/#Data_Transfer)  
See Workload components in same AWS Region in [Overview of Data Transfer Costs for Common Architectures](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/architecture/overview-of-data-transfer-costs-for-common-architectures/). 
  
Normal routing to subnets can send traffic between AZs.
  
#### Single-AZ
  
Each [AZ ID](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/global-infrastructure/latest/regions/az-ids.html) is associated with a specific location consistently, but AZ code mappings to AZs are randomized per account.  
[Use consistent Availability Zones in VPCs across different AWS accounts](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/prescriptive-guidance/latest/patterns/use-consistent-availability-zones-in-vpcs-across-different-aws-accounts.html)

These are things that live in in one AZ in one region. For redundancy in hopes of improving availability you can make more of them in different AZs. You choose the subset of AZs and most things cost more per AZ.

Load Balancers need to be enabled in the same AZ as their targets

# Multi-Partition
  
I believe the possible locations for resources in different partitions would be mutually exclusive. Using more than one partition seems very unlikely, but if you did want to duplicate something across partitions you'd have to do it yourself by transferring data through standard protocols. AWS would not do it for you.
