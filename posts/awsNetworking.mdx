Ways to get things in AWS connected to each other and the outside world

## [VPC](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/what-is-amazon-vpc.html) (virtual private networks)

- Route to Internet Gateway to make public subnet
- Route to NAT to allow private subnets to access Internet

## [Peering](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/peering/what-is-vpc-peering.html)

- Eseentially merge VPCs
- Connect networks in different regions
- Free within same Availability Zone
- Must avoid IP conflicts

## [Transit Gateway](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/tgw/what-is-transit-gateway.html)

- Interconnect VPCs and other networks
- Charged for attachment existence and amount of data traversed
- Control routing between attached networks
- Inter-region peering

## PrivateLink Endpoint Types

A summary of different ways to use AWS PrivateLink.

| Endpoint Type                                                                                                               | Things Accessed                                                                                                              | Self-managed Ingress Point | Traffic Type     |

| [GatewayLoadBalancer](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/privatelink/vpce-gateway-load-balancer.html)                   | virtual security appliances                                                                                                  | gateway LB                 | IP (OSI level 3) |
| [Resource](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/privatelink/privatelink-access-resources.html#resource-endpoint-overview) | host, or hosts (such as DBs)                                                                                                 | resource gateway (no LB)   | TCP              |

Charged endpiont existence and amount of data processed

## VPC Lattice

Controls connectivity and routing, but not load balancing

## Load Balancing

Provides a network ingress point that distributes traffic to hosts

| type        | purpose                         |
| ----------- | ------------------------------- |
| Application | HTTP, HTTPS, rule based routing |
| Network     | high performance TCP, UPD, TLS  |
| Gateway     | security appliances             |
| Classic     | TCP, TLS, sticky sessions       |

Any cross region?

## Connecting to other networks

- VPN sets up IPsec tunnels
- DirectConeect sets up real networks provided by AWS to bypass your usual ISP

## AWS Global Network

- CloudFront provides endpoints and caching near clients
- Global Accelerator routes traffic from endpints near clients over AWS's global network for slightly better latency

## Management Tools

- Network Manager
- IP Address Manager (IPAM)

## HTTP focus

- API Gateway - Mostly RESTish, websockets, access control, manage deployment, manage usage
- AppSync - GraphQL resolved by Lambda, DynamoDB, Aurora, OpenSearch, or HTTP endpoints (such as API Gateway)
- Lambda URLs

Any cross region?

## DNS

- Route53 is alobal (not regional) service
- DNS servers are provided in VPCs
- Charged for custom domain names, custom DNS management (hosted zones), DNS queries, and host health checks
- Fancy routing: failover, geolocaiton, geo proximity, lowest latenecy, multiple answers, weighted
- Firewall domain name filtering

## Extra security

- [Traffic Mirroring](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/mirroring/what-is-traffic-mirroring.html) allows inspection
- [GatewayLoadBalancer](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/privatelink/vpce-gateway-load-balancer.html) allows inspecton
- [WAF](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/waf-chapter.html) Filters based on rules
- [Shield](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/shield-chapter.html) Protects from DDOS
- [Firewall Manaager](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/fms-chapter.html)
- [Network Firewall](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/network-firewall/latest/developerguide/what-is-aws-network-firewall.html)
- [Guard Duty](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/guardduty/latest/ug/what-is-guardduty.html) Monitors logs (beyond just networking) for suspicious behavior
