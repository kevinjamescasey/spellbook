## Pros
* Convenient free UI allows someone unfamiliar to easily see the work flow and current state of executions
  - don't have to look for code and documentation
  - especially useful during prod support

* Keeps track of very long running executions without having to manage state yourself in persistent stores


## Cons

* The UI is only available to technical staff that use the AWS console

* Customizability of UIs and integrations could be much better if you keep the execution state of workflows in your own custom database and buid your own custom web API

* Everything baked into the the proprietary workflow logic is difficult to break apart for component testing
  - you can test individual Lambda functions, Batch jobs, etc but the workflow logic only runs in the AWS Step Functions service

* Authoring is done in visual workflow editor, but then merging and conflict resolution are done in JSON text files

* Workflow logic is heavily proprietary and not portable
  - Switching to ECS or something oustide of AWS will require rewriting
  
* Can't use any existing static analysis tools on workflow logic
  - linters
  
* Can't import libraries into workflow logic
  - third party library repositories don't exist?
  - reuse by copy-paste

* Can't benefit from the decades of design through from object oriented or functional paradigms
  - purely procedural
  - missing basic compositional abstractions like functions

* Extra layer of technology that has to be learned and context switched in addition to what is used in your Lambda functions and containers
  - Teams often avoid using multiple programming language ecosystems for this reason

## Equivalences

* Arrow to next step
  - two subsequent lines of code
  - queues between steps

* Braching arrows
  - any condtional logic like `if` or `switch case` blocks

* Execution log
  - regular logs or database state

* Current execution state
  - regular logs, database state, and persisttent queues

* Wait states
  - event based or polling triggers
  
* Parallel states
  - multiple parallel queue consumers
  - async IO (e.g. making web calls in JavaScript)
  - any concurrency mechanism in any programming language

## When to avoid

Step Functions are not needed for very simple workflows like a series of non-branching steps.

For very complicated workflows it is probably better to store custom state or make custom UIs.

[3 pitfalls](https://www.readysetcloud.io/blog/allen.helton/when-not-to-use-step-functions/)
    - large amounts of data being passed around
    - large amounts of parallel processing
    - requires additional adapter layers built out of Lambda functions for integrations


## The Niche

Step Functions might be ideal ...
For medium complexity workflows with a little bit of branching logic or waiting for human interaction.
For workflows that will not be developed into something more substational and will always be managed by an IT team rather than end users.
