When creating a new project it helps to duplicate an existing structure as a starting point. Directories arranged in a certain way can provide organization and files can provide scripting, configuration, and starting samples.

By "project" I just mean a directory with files and subdirectories.

### Brute Force

How about just copy the directory of an existing project and modify the parts you don't want to remain the same?

One method with `git` and GitHub's `gh` CLIs:
```
git clone <old_repo_url>
cp -r <old_repo> <new_repo>
cd <new_repo>
git remote rm origin
gh repo create -s . --public
git push --mirror
```

This method preserves commit history and branches which you might not want.

### Template or Scaffolding Methods

These methods use existing projects and tools that were meant for creating new projects.

- [GitHub template repository](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-template-repository)
- [`npm init <initializer>`](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v10/commands/npm-inithttps://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v10/commands/npm-init)
  - npm package named "create-\<initializer\>" runs to create the new directory
- [Yeoman](https://yeoman.io/)
- [Vercel Templates](https://vercel.com/templates)
- [Netlify Templates](https://www.netlify.com/integrations/templates/)
- [projen](https://projen.io/)
  - This tool makes it almost unbearably difficult to make simple configuration changes for popular highly documented tools because it doesn't allow you to edit the configuration directly and instead forces you to explore poorly documented projen code. It turns 5 minute web search and update config solutions into 30+ minute code investigations.
  - The idea is that by not allowing direct authoring it can prevent drift from a centralized configuration allowing config updates via code to propogate to all projects that update to the latest version of the centralized config.
  - Use this if you want strict application of the Don't Repeat Yourself principle (DRY) and permanent centrally controlled conformity across several projects
