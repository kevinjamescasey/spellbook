When creating a new project it helps to duplicate an existing structure as a starting point. Directories arranged in a certain way can provide organization and files can provide scrpting, configuration, and starting samples.

By "project" I just mean a directory with files and subdirectories.

### Brute Force

How about just copy the directory of an existing project and modify the parts you don't want to remain the same?

One method with `git` and GitHub's `gh` CLIs:
```
git clone <old_repo_url>
cp -r <old_repo> <new_repo>
cd <new_repo>
git remote rm origin
gh repo create -s . --public
git push --mirror
```

This method perserves commit history and branches which you might not want.

### Template or Scaffolding Methods

These methods use exising projects and tools that were meant for creating new projects.

- [GitHub template repository](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-template-repository)
- [`npm init <initializer>`](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v10/commands/npm-inithttps://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v10/commands/npm-init)
  - npm package named "create-\<initializer\>" runs to create the new directory
