These are popular CLI package installation tools for each OS, not an exaustive list. There are some basic commands to help you quickly get done what you need.

For the examples, `p` is a stand-in for the name of the package so substitute a real package name for `p`.


### Linux
<details>
<summary>Linux</summary>

Run this to see what is already installed
```
which apt snap yum
```

Canonical is trying to push [Snap](https://snapcraft.io/docs) as a universal Linux package installer.

#### Debian, Ubuntu
<details>
<summary> apt</summary>

```
apt install p
apt remove p
apt list --installed
apt update # get latest package index
apt upgrade # upgrade packages to the latest version
apt list --upgradable # see which pacages can be updated
apt search p
apt-cache search p
```

Debian has a whole mess of other tools including apt-get, dpkg, and aptitude.

#### RedHat, Fedora, CentOS, Amazon Linux

## Other OSes
This nice [Diagram of OS History and Relationships](https://www.reddit.com/media?url=https%3A%2F%2Fpreview.redd.it%2Fe21s2vb3a2a81.png%3Fwidth%3D4613%26format%3Dpng%26auto%3Dwebp%26s%3Da2bc24827b9caf90eb0c85dae83893976a6d8183) helps explain why some OSes, for example Debian and Ubuntu, tend to share the same tools. New OSes inhereit things from their ancestors. So if the OS you need to work with is not listed, there is a good chance the tools for its closest ancestor will work.
