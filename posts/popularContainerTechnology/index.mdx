This is meant to provide the trunk and largest branches of the tree of understanding. Follow them to the twigs, leaves, and fruit!

### Docker and Kubernetes

Docker is a heavily overloaded and confusing term that has long been synonymous with software containerization.

They try to explain [what containers are](https://www.docker.com/resources/what-container/) and they have no doubt played a huge role in creating and defining them.

Kubernetes, from Google, is very popular tool for managing many application containers on many hosts. 

### Terminology

Docker the company has provided every containerization component imaginable and they all fall under the "Docker" term umbrella. But now that others offer alternative components, it is good to have names for those types of components.

Even Docker's own documentation appears to contradict itself sometimes. The boundaries declared by the their definitions seem to migrate.

These existing glossaries leave me wanting better organization or focus on fundamentals.

+ [Redhat's Glossary](https://developers.redhat.com/blog/2018/02/22/container-terminology-practical-introduction#) generic with good long explanations
+ [Docker's Glossary](https://docs.docker.com/reference/glossary/) breaks Docker into components, but very Docker specific
+ [Kubernetes Glossary](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/glossary/?fundamental=true) generic containerization terms, with a bunch of Kubernetes specifics

There seems to be many pieces of software that act as both an engine and a runtime. Some of them also create virtual machines. So be wary of relying too much on any definition strictly.

#### Succint Glossary

These are the most important terms that I have gleaned from documentation and other glossaries.

| Term                   | Definition                                                                                   | Examples                                                                          |
|------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| container              | software from a container image running in a process with a limited and isolated environment |                                                                                   |
| container image        | file archive that contains other files required to run piece of software                     |                                                                                   |
| container registry     | a place to store, look up, and retrieve container iamges                                     |                                                                                   |
| container engine       | software that manages container images and containers often as a server for a client         | Docker, CRI-O, Railcar, RKT, LXC, Podman                                          |
| container runtime      | software component that container engines delegate container running to                      | runc, containerd, docker engine, incus, CRI-O, crun, railcar, katacontainers, MRC |
| container host         | machine with OS, virtual machine with OS, or another container where the conainers will run  |                                                                                   |
| container orchestrator | tool that starts, stops, and monitors containers often distrubted across multiple hosts      | Kubernetes, ECS, Docker Compose Swarm, whatever PaaSs use                         |
|                        |                                                                                              |                                                                                   |

### Local Machine Usage

These tools make it easy to run containers on your local machine and make it easy to use some of the same tools that you would use on remote machine clusters. They are good for learning, practicing, and developing.

Since container technology as defined by the [Open Container Initiative](https://opencontainers.org/) (part of Linux Foundation) and using [runc](https://github.com/opencontainers/runc) relies on Linux, virtual machines are often required on non-Linux OSes. These tools either provide or require the creation of Linux VMs which make it possible to run containers on non-Linux OSes.

``` shell
brew installl docker colima minikube kubectl
```

#### Docker Desktop

Docker Desktop was free for years, but it is no longer free for all uses. It provides everything you need to easily get started running containers.

The Homebrew `docker` package installs the CLI, but not the engine. If you want to use the engine you'll have to install Docker Deskstop.

Download it from [install Docker Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/mac-install/) or install it with
``` shell
brew info --cask docker
```

#### Colima

[Colima](https://github.com/abiosoft/colima) lets you easily run containers on macOS by creating Linux virtual machines. Unlike Docker Desktop, it is free for any use.

Use `colima start` to create a VM with a container engine and runtime.
Use `colima status` to see the current state.

#### Minikube

Minikube makes it easy to run Kubernetes on your local machine, but the [Minikube installation instructions](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/start/) say it requies a "container or virtual machine manager" which they apparently call "drivers". They point out several utilities for fulfilling the driver requirement that all appear to have the ability to create virtual machines. Installing either Docker Desktop or Colima are two easy ways to make it work.

Use `minikube start` to create a Kubernetes cluster.
`minikube start --driver=docker` allows amd64 images to run on arm64 machines, but it requires Docker Desktop to be installed and running. It will be the default driver if Docker Desktop is running, otherwise `qemu2` is the default which apparently comes with the Minikube (at least when installed by Homebrew).
Use `minikube status` to see the current state.

#### Comparing and Switching

These features allow you to create, view, and switch between multiple instances.

+ Create multiple instances of Minikube or Colima with the `-p, --profile` option
  + `minikube profile list` and `colima list` to see the profiles
+ Docker CLI can use environment variables to determine which server to issue commands to. You can use `eval $(minikube -p minikube docker-env)` to set up your shell so that `docker` CLI commands will use the server and runtime created by Minikube.
+ `docker context ls` lets you see and use different container engines through the same `docker` CLI
  + If the DOCKER_HOST variable is not set your shell you can set the current context with `docker context use CONTEXT`
  + Use the `-c --context` option with `docker` commands to target different engines, overriding the current context or env variable specified engine
+ `kubectl config get-contexts` shows which clusters exist and which one it is using


#### Try Out Commands

Run a container from a specified image

``` shell
docker run -d -p 8080:80 docker/welcome-to-docker
docker ps
```

[docker command Reference](https://docs.docker.com/reference/cli/docker/)

From [Hello Minikube](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tutorials/hello-minikube/)

``` shell
kubectl create deployment hello-node --image=registry.k8s.io/e2e-test-images/agnhost:2.39 -- /agnhost netexec --http-port=8080
kubectl get deployments
kubectl get deployments
kubectl get events
```

#### Deeper Understanding of Containers

What resources can software running in a container access? Obviously any running program needs CPU time and memory, but they can also be allowed to access storage and network.

Why use containers? They allow sharing and portability of the software packaged in the images no matter what was used to make the software. They allow running N different packages of software on one machine as if it was N machines so you don't have to worry about the programs interferring with each other. That allows sharing powerful compute resources across many disparate workloads.

These videos explain how Linux features allow the wonderful isolation and limited access that is the essence of containers and makes them so beneficial:

[Build your own Container Runtime](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOsWB50LmwQ)  


Apparently container runtimes can depend on or be composed of other container runtimes.This [conainterd vs Docker](https://www.docker.com/blog/containerd-vs-docker/) article has a diagram of component relationships. It explains how containerd uses runc.

This shows some typical relationships between the components
