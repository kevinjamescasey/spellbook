This is a collection of curated collections of computer technologies. Why? Because people love browsing categories.

It may not help you decide, but at least now you have a catalog of catalogs of available options. üòÅ ¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)\_/¬Ø

## Variety

[CloudNative](https://landscape.cncf.io/) back-end, hosting, devops, SRE, observability  
[Stackoverflow Survey](https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2024/technology/) programming, databases, cloud, web, tools, OS

## Programming

[Tiobe](https://www.tiobe.com/tiobe-index/) programming language index


## Data and AI

[Machine Learning, AI, and Data (MAD)](https://mattturck.com/landscape/mad2024.pdf)  
[ML](https://github.com/josephmisiti/awesome-machine-learning)

[Huggng Face model library](https://huggingface.co/models) also has data sets  
[Kaggle library](https://www.kaggle.com/models) also has data sets  

[Microsoft's list of companies that provide models](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/ai-model-catalog#Models) apparently certain non-partners are omitted

[Zalando Radar](https://opensource.zalando.com/tech-radar/)   (singel company)

## Techniques (without specific implementation for learning rather than directly using)

[ML model types list](https://medium.com/@codekalimi/list-of-machine-learning-models-61b51ad492f1)  some categories, not details  
[ML model types list](https://ai.stackexchange.com/questions/38093/a-comprehensive-list-of-machine-learning-algorithms)  some categories, no details  
[ML model types and techniques](https://machinelearningcatalogue.com/)  some explanation  
[ML model types by categories](https://machinelearningmastery.com/a-tour-of-machine-learning-algorithms/) some explanation  
[ML model types](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/index.html) scikit-learn provides real implementations, but the docs are helpful for learning
