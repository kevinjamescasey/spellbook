Agile that works

### Communicating People (team work makes the dream work)

I see these as an acknowledgment that the process is a creative one performed by and for infallible people. They are about empowering everyone involved to individually contribute more to the collective effort.

Modern Agile

- Make People Awesome
- Make Safety a Prerequisite

Manifesto for Agile Software Development

- Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
- Customer collaboration over contract negotiation

Nobody has perfect knowledge of what they want or need. Nobody has perfect knowledge of what is possible or probable. People are not predictable machines. People can be motivated and inspired to make better things if you allow them leeway and agency. If you box them in with rules it can hinder their creativity and progress while dampening their motivation. If you trust them, then you don't need to dictate rules.

In my first experience where an organization embraced an Agile philosophy they focused on ensuring that small teams had autonomy and it appeared to work well. Agile coaches would help teams bootstrap themselves into managing themselves. It seemed that everyone had a voice and retropsective disccussions often led to tangible changes. It was sometimes a struggle to get the collaboration we wanted with stakeholders outside the team, but when we focused on it we could come up with ways to improve our interactions with some of them.

At a couple other companies I worked on teams that claimed they were Agile, but how the teams ran was almost entirely dictated by a single person that supervised each team. Almost all aspcects of how the teams operated was not determined by the teams including meeting times, meeting frequency, meeting agenda, sprint lengths, work tracking, work organizing, work documenting, who should communicate with whom, who should contribute what, when certain activities should occur, priorities, timelines, which technologies should be used, strategies, etc. I noticed that the retrospectives for those teams were ineffective, because the teammates knew the supervisor was really in charge of deciding anything that mattered. They knew that changing anything they disagreed with would be a struggle because the person who originally dictated everything could overrule or at least cast the deciding vote and they'd likely need to convince everybody to make a difference. There is not a propensity to try an individual's idea in a team what was not involved in the inital decisions because they don't feel empowered to change those decisions. The team members knew they were not on equal footing with the person that made all of the decisions and they didn't take much interest in criticizing anything that stemmed from those decisions. The only problems ever discussed were frustrations that originated with interactions with people outside the team, like draconian bureaucracy, unresponsive teams, and uncooperative teams. The teams were not empowered to change much of anything that mattered to their success and were instead confined to execute tasks within the predefined boundaries.

The more that is dictated to people the less ownership the feel they have over what is produced. People don't put the same effort into improving their landlord's or their neighbors property as they do to their own. That sounds cynnical, but there is little risk or harm in trusting people with ownership of their own work. It is readily apparent that a team's team is naturally more motivated than a boss's team.

### Anti-Waterfall (you don't know where you're going until you get there)

I see these as a contradiction of the "waterfall" process that was used in the past and borrowed from traditional research, development, and engineering of physical inventions.

Modern Agile

- Experiment & Learn Rapidly
- Deliver Value Continuously

Manifesto for Agile Software Development

- Working software over comprehensive documentation
- Responding to change over following a plan

Experimenting and learning is done so you can respond accordingly to what you percieve as change. The change could be a new mandate or just your reinterpretation based on what you learned. The strategy is based on the assumption that you don't know everything at the start and that you are capable making better decisions later after learning more. This can cause a fear of never reaching your goal or never arriving at your destination due to constantly changing directions. That fear is mitigated by focusing on delivering value in the form of working software. Luckily it is usually possible to do this gradually. Even if you never arrive at the destination you planned on, there is often still value in getting to where you got to. Another important reason to deliver what value you can as early as you can is that the engagement you get with reality by stepping into the world is the only way to learn what is is you need to respond to. It is the most rapid way to learn. It gives you a better chance of getting to where you want to be before you run out of time.

In my first decade of work I was forced to attempt to follow the "waterfall" process and it never seemed to work well. It always broke down into a hidden more granular iterative process that was never officially acknowledged. There was a rigid adherance to the originally planned timelines and goals. It seemed like an immature an unwise way for those in charge to try to convince everyone that they were good leaders and knew all along exactly where we were going and how we would get there. When deadlines for milestones were inevitably missed the excuses and blaming would bubble up into a mostly unproductive investigation of missteps and mistakes. The whole thing was steeped in hubris and massive overestimation of human ability to mastermind unfathomably complex processes.

priortization example:
50% of teams time spent on prod maintenance and 50% spent on important business initiative
What if you can spend 50% of time for 2 months on lowering the maintenance burden to 5%. Then the team can spend 95% of their time on the important business initiative for the foreseeable future.

same scope
same priorities
same perspective
