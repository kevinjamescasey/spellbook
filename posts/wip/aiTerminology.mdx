Add a quote from the deep learning boko about how there is no inteliigence in AI yet, only automtated cognition. It is just technlogy inspired by intelligence and aspiring to be intelligent.

## not even AI
These are things in data science or computer science

linear programmming - like Gurobi solver
statistics


## ML basics
model
train
infer, inferrence

## Deep learning
neural network
gradient descent
perceptron
boltzmann machine
activation function
    ReLu 0 to infinity - rectified linear unit
    sigmoid 0 to 1
    threshold (step) like sigmoid with mroe abrupt change
    hyperbolic tangent - tanh -  like sigmoid but -1 to 1
    softmax results add up to one

cost function - amount of error between prediction and actual
convergence - cost function returns minimum possible value (lowest error)
RNN - recurrent
CNN - convolutional - convNet
feed forward?
deep?
deep belief?
LSTM -  long short term memory - more complicated RNN that remember more

image recognition
    CNN - twist and change
    ReLu
    max pooling/reducing - down sampling features
    flattened
    fully connected

quantization (vs regularization)
 both prune out bits but the location of the prunning is different
   whole weights or layers or dimensions vs half of each weight
 definitely different intents
 quantization is a more uniform loss of precision across the whole structure
  regularization is more targeted
 regularization techniques seem more sophisticated (landscaping)
  quantization is a simpler process (mowing)
