### Global (regionless/auto-multi-region)

Services that are location agnostic? AWS handles availability for you so you don't much care about the location?

[CloudFront 400+ points of presence](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/networking-and-content-delivery/400-amazon-cloudfront-points-of-presence/)
IAM
Route53

possibilities listed on google that I need to investigate further:
AWS Organizations, AWS Global Accelerator, AWS Direct Connect, AWS Firewall Manager, AWS Web Application Firewall (WAF), and AWS Shield

### Multi-AZ

These are things that live in VPCs.

Some things cost more to have redundancies cross AZ.
LBs
ElastiCache
DAX
ECS
EFS
RDS standby failover

Many things have cross AZ access within your VPC just to access the other things in your VPC:
DynamoDB

#### zoneless/auto-multi-AZ

AWS just tells you the availability percentage per time so you don't have to worry about specific AZs.

### Multi-Region

Services that feature cross-region capabilities but you have to set it up and it costs more.
