# Global (regionless/auto-multi-region)

Services that can be location agnostic so you don't have to set up each region separately and figure out how to use each region at the appropriate time. You still need to configure these to integrate with your region-specific resources.

[CloudFront 400+ points of presence](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/networking-and-content-delivery/400-amazon-cloudfront-points-of-presence/) (has cheaper versions that aren't fully global)
IAM
Route53
[Shield](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/ddos-advanced-summary-protected-resources.html)
[WAF](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/how-aws-waf-works-resources.html)
Firewall Manager
Global Accelerator

These services are essentially assumed to have 100% uptime. We blindly trust AWS to make them always available by whatever means they choose. We don't really need to know if they make a few copies in different regions or thousands of copies spread out all over.

possibilities listed on google that I need to investigate further:
AWS Organizations, AWS Direct Connect 

### Multi-Region

Services that feature cross-region capabilities but you have to set it up and it costs more for each region.

### Single Region 

#### zoneless or auto-multi-AZ

The VPC itself (without subnets)
Internet Gateway
SQS queue
SNS topic
EventBridge bus

#### Multi-AZ
These are things that live in VPCs. VPCs are single region resources. You typically configure them to use multiple subnets each in a different availability zone. 

Some things cost more to have redundancies cross AZ.
LBs
ElastiCache
DAX
ECS
EKS
EFS
RDS standby failover
App Runner ?
Glue ?
Amplify?





### Multi-Partition

I belie
do it yourself by transferring data through standard protocols?
