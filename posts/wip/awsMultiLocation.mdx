# Beyond Regions

Services with high replication so you don't have to set up each region separately and figure out how to use each region at the appropriate time. You still need to configure these to integrate with your region-specific resources.

These services are essentially assumed to have 100% uptime. We blindly trust AWS to make them always available by whatever means they choose. We don't really need to know if they make a few copies in different regions or thousands of copies spread out all over.

# Multi-Region

Services that feature cross-region capabilities but you have to set it up and it costs more for each region.

# Single Region

Resources with no way to copy or automatically replicate to another region. You can create more of them in other regions yourself.



#### zoneless or auto-multi-AZ

AMC certs
The VPC itself (without subnets)
Internet Gateway
SQS queue
SNS topic
EventBridge bus
Lambda function (can access subnets with ENIs)
Glue (can access subnets with ENIs)
App Runner ([can access subnets with ENIs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apprunner/latest/dg/network-vpc.html))
DynamoDB

Amplify?
DocumentDB?

... tons of service resource fall in this single-region category

! These singe-region sections are incomplete and not entirely clear. 

#### Multi-AZ
These are things that live in a VPC subnet in one AZ in one region. For redundancy in hopes of improving availability you can make more of them in different AZs. 

Some things cost more to have redundancies cross AZ.

ElastiCache
DAX
ECS

# Multi-Partition

I believe the possible locations for resources in different partitions would be mutually exclusive. Using more than one partition seems very unlikely, but if you did want to duplicate something across partitions you'd have todo it yourself by transferring data through standard protocols. AWS would not do it for you.
