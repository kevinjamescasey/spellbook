## VPC Basics

## Peering

- Eseentially merge VPCs
- Connect networks in different regions
- Free within same Availability Zone
- Must avoid IP conflicts

## Transit Gateway

- Interconnect VPCs and other networks
- Charged for attachments and amount of data traversing
- Control routing between attached networks

## PrivateLink Endpoint Types

A summary of different ways to use AWS PrivateLink.

| Endpoint Type                                                                                                               | Things Accessed                                                                                                              | Self-managed Ingress Point | Traffic Type     |

## VPC Lattice

Controls connectivity and routing, but not load balancing

## Load Balancing

## Connecting to other networks

- VPN sets up IPsec tunnels
- DirectConeect sets up real networks provided by AWS to bypass your usual ISP

## AWS Global Network

CloudFront and Global Accelerator

## Management Tools

- Network Manager
- IP Address Manager (IPAM)
