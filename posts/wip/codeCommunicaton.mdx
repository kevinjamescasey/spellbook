How can data be passed between lines of code?

```
intrathread - no concurrency issues
interthread - concurrency issues
    intraprocess - independent of OS
    interprocess - requires OS support
        intracontainer
        intercontainer - requires networking software
            intramachine
            intermachine - requires networking hardware
                intranetwork
                internetwork
```

other levels to consider: vm, rack, network, building, city, country...

how does code end up in same process?

- same binary file
- linked binary files
- same type of bytecode loaded onto same vm from files
- fetched over network
