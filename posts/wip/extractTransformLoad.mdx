Extract Transform Load (ETL) really means copy from one storage location, transform the copy, then copy the transformed copy into another storage location. Maybe it should be called Copy Transform Copy (CTC).

What does "transform" even mean? Is it any possible computation that can be done? Do we need to think about Turing machines and computablility theory? Does it allow combining the data copied from one location with other data? Or does it need to behave as if it involves a pure function that only takes input from the one location?
