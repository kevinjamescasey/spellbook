** mtmproxy
   https://mitmproxy.org/
   different proxy configurations https://docs.mitmproxy.org/stable/concepts-modes/
   must configure system or client proxy settings yourself
   must import CA cert yourself
   worst UI
   can pause matched traffic for editing
   cannot add header to request
   difficult to intercept traffic to localhost servers: had to add "127.0.0.1 mysite.local" to Windows/System32/Drivers/Etc
** fiddler
   https://www.telerik.com/fiddler
   (requires log in, allows Google)
   by default records all http messages on system by changing system proxy settings
   can allow passthrough of traffic that doesn't match any rule
   best UI
** http toolkit
   https://httptoolkit.tech/
   intercept and record http messages for specific clients
   does not affect all traffic on system
   simple matching for mocking
   pause and edit live messages
   cannot replay
   decent UI
