## containers

better list of tutrial commands from fresh install
  run an image as a container

add podman to container essentials?

try kind multi-node clusters (and minikube)


Can`kubeadm` be used locally

multi-architecture images?

## virtualization
more info about vms, hypervisors,


## CPU architectures

The chip manufacturers can name their architectures whatever they want.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_instruction_set_architectures

The OS kernel makers can also use whatever names they want to refer to the architectures.
https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/v6.3/arch.html 

Compiler makers can also use whatever names they want to refer to the OSs and architectures.
`go tool dist list` shows combinations supprted by GoLang
https://www.graalvm.org/22.3/docs/introduction/#features-support

## how to

Try using popular Python libraries with Clojure interop on GraalVM

## Gatsby

StaticImage can be included in pages but not in collection route node pages
  had to use GraphQl filter to specify one image and then GatsbyImage to display it

## endpoints

many definitions within a security context say endpoints are computers at the end of networks 
  https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/security/glossary/what-is-endpoint/ (says load balancers are not endpoints)
  https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/business/security-101/what-is-an-endpoint
  https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/cyberpedia/what-is-an-endpoint
  https://www.crowdstrike.com/en-us/cybersecurity-101/endpoint-security/endpoint/
  https://www.trellix.com/security-awareness/endpoint/what-is-endpoint-security/

definitions of HTTP endpoints suggest that the endpoint would be at the location of the load balancer or API gateway regardless of how many machines serve up responses

### scope of side effects

calling a function affects real physical memory in the computer
making a netwwork call affects the state of the wires and remote machines

this side effect definition limits the scope of the word "effect" https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Side_effect_(computer_science) 

calling a pure function just uses some memory and CPU and doesn't affect any state that survives beyond the life of the function exectution
  the amount used could vary depending on memoization
  it uses energy and generates heat (significant in aggregate)
  if there is plenty of memory available and memory is allocated and deallocated well, then it shouldn't affect other processes 

The impact of the effects and the risk of the effects causing a problem is lower with pure functions.
