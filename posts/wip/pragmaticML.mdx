how is data moved?
  data pipelines
    ETL
    ElT
    replication
    streaming
    batch
    orchestration tools
        apache airflow
        AWS glue?

how is data transformed?
    ETL
      queries

    ElT
      dbt
    
how are models trained?
  is continuous learning a thing?
    It is suggested in books but I don't think it happens much.
    They are replaced by new versions
    If you let the model change while in production you don't know how well it performs
      unless you're somehow continuously testing
  algorithms reading in data and outputting data
    many implementations of many algorithms
      libraries
        scikit learn
        spark mllib
        deep learning
          pytorch, tensorflow, ...
      many more in many programming languages
  cross validation
    k folds
  

how are models stored/persisted/serialized/checkpionted?
  file formats
    NNs - GGUF, safetensors
    scikit-learn - https://scikit-learn.org/stable/model_persistence.html
  storage locations
    compressed archive files stored anywhere
      S3, GitHub, any web server, etc.
  repositories
    kaggle
    hugging face
    [TensorFlow Hub](https://www.tensorflow.org/hub)
    cloud providers

how are models managed?
  declaring dependencies?
  fetching from a central source?
  are supply chain attacks via models ineffectual because they are just data and not code?
  continuous testing?

how is inference provided?
 algorithm that reeads in input subject datum and model data then outputs mapped answer
   some inference have loops that feed the mapped outputs back in as the next subject datum
     for example, LLMs predict the next token one at a time in a loop
