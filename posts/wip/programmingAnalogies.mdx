A programming language is like a room full of tool chests. Over time old tool chests get pushed into the corner and new tool chests are rolled in. The tool room is a part of a larger workshop building with larger equipment, processed materials, and composite components.

We want to strive to make software that is like self-assembled furniture. It is easy to assemble with minimal tools and minmal components. Often the same furniture components can be composed in different ways to make different pieces of furniture. That is also a desired trait of sofware components. Unlike furniture there is no need to assemble software in the same way more than once since we just host software centrally or distributed copies of it. And we rarely expect software consumers/users to assemble software themselves. Maybe systems with a market of plugins or extensions are similar to self-assembly. Software frameworks made for other engineers to use require much self-assembly, but they also involve far more customizatino than you would expect of furniture. Maybe closet organizer systems have more variety in the final assembly than furniture. 

Rich Hickey has popularized a comparison of a knitted castle to a Lego castle. It is a useful to illustrate the difference between. Real software never seems as uniform as either all yarn or all Lego, it has some parts that are tangled and some parts that are more easily changed out. Furniture with its greater variety of component shapes, size, and materials is a better match for typical software.
