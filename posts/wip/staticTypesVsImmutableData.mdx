Type systems show us all over your screen as type declarations and errors. The mess they make in your face makes it appear that types are very complicated and causing lots of problems. This makes it seem like wrtinging good programs without static type checking is hopeless. A large part of that visible mess is caused by the type system itself, so it helps convince people that it is necessary.

Messes that happen within the composite data structures in your program are almost completely hidden. You only see little glimpses of them when you they are printed out. You almost never see a graphical representation of them like you would draw. The mess shows up in the form of test errors and production bugs that you associate with the code. It is the code that causes any mistakes or mess in the data, but it is also the code that causes any type errors.

With types we create endless rules and then have an enforcing on duty to check that every single change follows every single rule. But for the values within those types we often have no enforced rules at all. We spot check with mostly hand written sample inputs and hand written inspection of outputs. Within the constraints of what the type system allows there are hardly any contraints on what can be modified and when.
