These are mostly tested on macOS, but might work similarly on other OSes.

# remote machines

## check if server is accepting TCP connection on port
nc -vzw 3 host port # Ubuntu
nc -vzG 3 host port # Mac

## crude single-sample latency measure
time nc -zw30 host port

## use ping sweep to discover hosts
nmap -sn 192.168.1.0/24

## port scan specific hosts agressively
nmap -A -T4 192.168.1.1,7,134,162,215

# local machine

## Find use of local ports

Show PID and command using a port `<PortNumber>`
``` shell
sudo lsof -i :<PortNumber>
```

Show network connections (active sockets) for a protocol
``` shell
netstat -lnp tcp
```
`-n` shows numeric addresses instead of names
`-l` shows full IPv6 addresses

*** which pids are using network
netstat -tulpn 
lsof -i

## show in use resources
Show pids using a file
fuser file


## Install DNS tools on Amazon Linux 2

``` shell
sudo yum install bind-utils
```

## Install and run Apache web server on Amazon Linux 2 EC2 instance

Paste this in the user data of the instance
``` shell
yum update -y
yum install -y httpd
systemctl start httpd
systemctl enable httpd
echo "<h1>Hello World from $(hostname -f)</h1>" > /var/www/html/index.html
```

## Start the Apache web server that comes on Mac

``` shell
sudo apachectl start
```

The root is in `/Library/WebServer/Documents/index.html.en` and by default can only be edited by root.
The config is in `/private/etc/apache2/httpd.conf`

## Find the public IP address that your internet traffic is coming from
curl ipinfo.io
curl icanhazip.com

## Attempt to resolve a DNS name to an IP address
nslookup name.tld
dig name.tld
host name.tld

## View response from HTTP GET request
curl name.tld
wget -qO- name.tld

## find local IP
hostname -I
ip route get 1.2.3.4 | awk '{print $7}'
ifconfig
netstat
